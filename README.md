## Kate Gleeson

I'm a freshly minted Makers Academy graduate with a love of programming, programming and programming.  Most especially, of producing clean, elegant and resilient code.  For me coding is about building one simple, logical solution on top of another until I have something amazing.

I'm good at learning - getting to grips with unfamiliar tools and languages, hunting down answers to difficult questions, and sometimes just nagging at a problem until it surrenders.   

## Skills

#### Learning

I'm intellectually curious and enjoy developing new skills.  Those I've tackled in the past include teaching, working as a Junior Doctor, designing, animal care and gardening.  

#### Creativity

I have an original and arguably overactive imagination and I like to use it!  

#### Adaptability

I've worked in a lot of diverse environments, from hospitals and schools to toyshops and organic farms.  I lived in a caravan in a field full of donkeys once.   

#### Resilience

I've worked as a doctor, which is really hard.  It involves long hours, an often relentless work load, and making really difficult, sometimes genuinely life or death, decisions.  Medicine wasn't for me, in the end, but it has taught me to handle hard work.

## Education

* A solid grounding in Ruby and JavaScript (plus jQuery) along with relevant testing frameworks.
* A working knowledge of HTML and CSS.
* Competence with Sinatra, Rails and Node.js.
* Confidence working with databases.
* The knowledge and confidence to work independently, and to find out what I need to know.  For our final project me and my intrepid team taught ourselves about web VR, learned how to write an Alexa skill...and figured out how to link them up, with some pretty cool results (<a href="https://github.com/allbecauseyoutoldmeso/spaceship">see here</a>).
