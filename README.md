Full stack developer working primarily with Ruby on Rails.

For me coding is about building one simple, logical solution on top of another until I have something amazing.

I'm good at learning - getting to grips with unfamiliar tools and languages, hunting down answers to difficult questions, and sometimes just nagging at a problem until it surrenders.   

Skills I've tackled in the past include teaching, working as a Junior Doctor, graphic design, animal care and organic farming.  I love fresh challenges and I'm good at adapting to new environments.
