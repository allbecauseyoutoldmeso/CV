I'm a freshly minted Makers Academy graduate with a love of programming, programming and programming.  Most especially of producing clean, elegant and resilient code.  For me coding is about building one simple, logical solution on top of another until I have something amazing.

I'm good at learning - getting to grips with unfamiliar tools and languages, hunting down answers to difficult questions, and sometimes just nagging at a problem until it surrenders.   

Skills I've tackled in the past include teaching, working as a Junior Doctor, graphic design, animal care and organic farming.  I love fresh challenges and I'm good at adapting to new environments.

## Education

#### Makers Academy
* A solid grounding in Ruby and JavaScript along with relevant testing frameworks.
* Familiarity with common front-end languages and with web app frameworks such as Rails and Node.js.
* Experience of and enthusiasm for pair-coding and teamwork.
* A firm belief in TDD.  
* The understanding and confidence to work independently and to find out what I need to know.  For our final project I and my intrepid team taught ourselves about web VR, learned how to write an Alexa skill...and figured out how to link them up, with <a href="https://github.com/allbecauseyoutoldmeso/spaceship">some pretty cool results</a>.
